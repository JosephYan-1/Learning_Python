# *LEARNING PYTHON*

Just messing around with python, I will be doing file writing, fib, and just basic arithmetic
Will add input features (input data, do x with data)

*SKIPPING HELLOWORLD* because its just 
print(blahblah) o.o

# How I will continue updating this github page
I am currently working on a game in python (pygames)

I will be using this as a sandbox whenever I need (some cases off the top of my head):
* Classes
* Array/list control
